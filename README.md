# Face-Recognition-Appliaction-for-Attendance-Facenet-MTCNN
This Application can detect faces and identify person for attendance or you can use it for other pusrpose as well

# Requirements:

* **Hardware Requirements:** A computer with a webcam and internet connectivity is needed to run the system. The webcam should have a resolution of at least 720p to capture clear images.

* **Software Requirements:** The system will be built using Python programming language. The required software includes a Python IDE like PyCharm or Spyder, OpenCV library, face_recognition library, and NumPy library.

* **Facial Recognition Algorithm:** The system will use a facial recognition algorithm to recognize faces. The algorithm should be able to detect faces and extract facial features accurately.
 
* **User Interface:** The system should have a user-friendly interface to capture images, display results, and generate reports.

* **Attendance Management:** The system should be able to manage attendance records for each person, including the date and time of attendance.

**Overall, the Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition should be reliable, efficient, and easy to use. It should automate attendance-taking and provide accurate and timely attendance records.**

# Create a new environment
Step 1 : open your anaconda prompt (for windows user search inside start menu )
                                   (for Ubuntu and Mac user you can open your terminal)

Step 2 : Create a new environment

                command : conda create -n facerecognition python==3.6.9
                
Step 3 : activate your environment

                conda activate facerecognition
                
Step 4 : Install requirements.txt in the newly created environment

  a). Navigate to your folder location on anaconda prompt/teminal
                    for me ( /PycharmProjects/FaceRecogAcademy )
                    for your folderName
                    
   b). Check if we have requirements.txt or not in the current directory
            

                    command : for windows (dir)
                              for Mac/Ubuntu(ls)
                              
                    datasets,  How to run.txt,  requirements.txt,  src

   you should see the above mentioned name of files.

                    if yes:
                        Your are good to go
                    elif No:
                        Please check the steps again you must have missed something

Step 5 : Installation and setup is done:
         a).  cd src
         b). python clientApp.py
         Yor are good to go ........................................
